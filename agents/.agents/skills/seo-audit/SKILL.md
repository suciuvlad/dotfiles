# Full Website SEO Audit
## Shared Data Cache

**Step 0 -- Check shared data cache:**

Before gathering, check `.seo-cache/` for reusable context from related SEO skills.
Reference: `../seo/references/shared-data-cache.md` for schemas and dependency map.

Check these cache files when present:
- `.seo-cache/site-meta.json` for domain, business type, industry, and crawl context
- `.seo-cache/audit-scores.json` for prior full-audit priorities
- `.seo-cache/pages/{url-slug}/page-analysis.json` for page-level context when a URL is provided

- If found: parse and use clearly valid fields (note "Using cached [X] from [date]")
- If missing, corrupt, or irrelevant: continue with fresh evidence
- If the user says "refresh" or "re-run": ignore cache reads and overwrite on write

## Process

1. **Fetch homepage**: use `scripts/fetch_page.py` to retrieve HTML
2. **Detect business type**: analyze homepage signals per seo orchestrator
3. **Crawl site**: follow internal links up to 500 pages, respect robots.txt
4. **Delegate to subagents** (if available, otherwise run inline sequentially):
   - `seo-technical` -- robots.txt, sitemaps, canonicals, Core Web Vitals, security headers
   - `seo-content` -- E-E-A-T, readability, thin content, AI citation readiness
   - `seo-schema` -- detection, validation, generation recommendations
   - `seo-sitemap` -- structure analysis, quality gates, missing pages
   - `seo-performance` -- LCP, INP, CLS measurements
   - `seo-visual` -- screenshots, mobile testing, above-fold analysis
   - `seo-geo` -- AI crawler access, llms.txt, citability, brand mention signals
   - `seo-local` -- GBP signals, NAP consistency, reviews, local schema, industry-specific local factors (spawn when Local Service industry detected: brick-and-mortar, SAB, or hybrid business type)
   - `seo-maps` -- Geo-grid rank tracking, GBP audit, review intelligence, competitor radius mapping (spawn when Local Service detected AND DataForSEO MCP available)
   - `seo-google` -- CWV field data (CrUX), URL indexation (GSC), organic traffic (GA4) (spawn when Google API credentials detected via `python scripts/google_auth.py --check`)
   - `seo-backlinks` -- Backlink profile data: DA/PA, referring domains, anchor text, toxic links (spawn when Moz or Bing API credentials detected via `python scripts/backlinks_auth.py --check`, or always include Common Crawl domain-level metrics)
   - `seo-cluster` -- Semantic clustering analysis (spawn when content strategy signals detected: blog, pillar pages, topic clusters)
   - `seo-sxo` -- Search experience analysis: page-type mismatch, user stories, persona scoring (always include in full audits)
   - `seo-drift` -- Drift analysis: compare against stored baseline (spawn when drift baseline exists for the URL via `python scripts/drift_history.py <url>`)
   - `seo-ecommerce` -- Product schema, marketplace intelligence (spawn when E-commerce industry detected)
5. **Score** -- aggregate into SEO Health Score (0-100)
6. **Report** -- generate prioritized action plan

## Crawl Configuration

```
Max pages: 500
Respect robots.txt: Yes
Follow redirects: Yes (max 3 hops)
Timeout per page: 30 seconds
Concurrent requests: 5
Delay between requests: 1 second
```

## Output Files

- `FULL-AUDIT-REPORT.md`: Comprehensive findings
- `ACTION-PLAN.md`: Prioritized recommendations (Critical > High > Medium > Low)
- `screenshots/`: Desktop + mobile captures (if Playwright available)
- **PDF Report** (recommended): Generate a professional A4 PDF using `scripts/google_report.py --type full`. This produces a white-cover enterprise report with TOC, executive summary, charts (Lighthouse gauges, query bars, index donut), metric cards, threshold tables, prioritized recommendations with effort estimates, and implementation roadmap. Always offer PDF generation after completing an audit.

- **Medium**: Optimization opportunity (fix within 1 month)
- **Low**: Nice to have (backlog)

## DataForSEO Integration (Optional)

If DataForSEO MCP tools are available, spawn the `seo-dataforseo` agent alongside existing subagents to enrich the audit with live data: real SERP positions, backlink profiles with spam scores, on-page analysis (Lighthouse), business listings, and AI visibility checks (ChatGPT scraper, LLM mentions).

## Google API Integration (Optional)

If Google API credentials are configured (`python scripts/google_auth.py --check`), spawn the `seo-google` agent to enrich the audit with real Google field data: CrUX Core Web Vitals (replaces lab-only estimates), GSC URL indexation status, search performance (clicks, impressions, CTR), and GA4 organic traffic trends. The Performance (CWV) category score benefits most from field data.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| URL unreachable (DNS failure, connection refused) | Report the error clearly. Do not guess site content. Suggest the user verify the URL and try again. |
| robots.txt blocks crawling | Report which paths are blocked. Analyze only accessible pages and note the limitation in the report. |
| Rate limiting (429 responses) | Back off and reduce concurrent requests. Report partial results with a note on which sections could not be completed. |
| Timeout on large sites (500+ pages) | Cap the crawl at the timeout limit. Report findings for pages crawled and estimate total site scope. |

## Write to shared data cache

After completing all work, write a concise JSON summary to `.seo-cache/` when the workflow produced durable findings.
Use the schemas and naming rules in `../seo/references/shared-data-cache.md`; include at least `cache_type`, `analyzed_at`, source URL/domain, key findings, issues, recommendations, and tool limitations. Add `.seo-cache/` to `.gitignore` if it is missing.
