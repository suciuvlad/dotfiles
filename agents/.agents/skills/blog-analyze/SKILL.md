# Blog Analyzer: Quality Audit & Scoring

Scores blog posts on a 0-100 scale across 5 categories and provides prioritized
improvement recommendations. Includes AI content detection analysis. Works with
local files or published URLs.

Reference documents (paths from repo root):
- `skills/blog/references/quality-scoring.md`: full scoring checklist
- `skills/blog/references/eeat-signals.md`: E-E-A-T evaluation criteria
- `skills/blog/references/ai-slop-detection.md`: two-tier reflex methodology (v1.8.0)
- `skills/blog/references/editorial-heuristics.md`: ordinal 0-4 rubric, P0-P3 severity (v1.8.0, used with `--rubric`)
- `skills/blog/references/cognitive-load.md`: per-section concept density (v1.8.0, used with `--cognitive-load`)

## Input Handling

- **Local file**: Read the file directly
- **URL**: Fetch with WebFetch, extract content
- **Directory**: Scan for blog files, audit all (batch mode)
- **Flags**: `--format json|table`, `--batch`, `--sort score`, `--rubric`, `--cognitive-load`

### Optional Modes (v1.8.0)

- `--rubric`: in addition to the 100-point score, emit the ordinal 0-4 editorial-heuristics rubric with P0-P3 severity tags. See `skills/blog/references/editorial-heuristics.md`. The 100-point JSON schema is preserved; the rubric is added as a sibling `rubric` field.
- `--cognitive-load`: run `scripts/cognitive_load.py` against the post and embed the per-section load heatmap as a sibling `cognitive_load` field. See `skills/blog/references/cognitive-load.md`.

Both modes are additive. The default behavior (no flags) is unchanged from v1.7.1.

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Content Extraction

Read the blog post and extract:
- Frontmatter (title, description, date, lastUpdated, author, tags)
- Heading structure (H1, H2, H3 with hierarchy)
- Paragraph count and word counts per paragraph
- Statistics (any number claims with or without sources)
- Images (count, alt text presence, format)
- Charts/SVGs (count, type diversity)
- Links (internal, external, broken)
- FAQ section presence
- Schema markup (types present)
- Meta tags (title, description, OG tags, twitter cards)
- Sentence lengths for burstiness analysis
- Vocabulary tokens for diversity scoring

### Step 2: Score Each Category

Load `references/quality-scoring.md` for the full checklist. Score each:

#### Content Quality (30 points)
| Check | Points | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Depth/comprehensiveness | 7 | Covers topic thoroughly, no major gaps |
| Readability (Flesch 60-70) | 7 | Flesch 60-70 ideal, 55-75 acceptable; Grade 7-8; Gunning Fog 7-8 |
| Originality/unique value markers | 5 | Original data, case studies, first-hand experience |
| Sentence & paragraph structure | 4 | Avg sentence 15-20 words, ≤25% over 20; paragraphs 40-80 words; H2 every 200-300 words |
| Engagement elements | 4 | Summary box, callouts, varied content blocks. Accepts: "TL;DR", "Key Takeaways", "The Bottom Line", "What You'll Learn", "At a Glance", "In Brief" |
| Grammar/anti-pattern | 3 | Passive voice ≤10%, AI trigger words ≤5/1K, transition words 20-30%, clean prose |

**Readability Bands** (apply per persona, or use default):

| Audience | Flesch Grade | Flesch Ease | Scoring Impact |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Consumer | 6-8 | 60-80 | Full points if in range |
| Professional | 8-10 | 50-60 | Full points if in range |
| Technical | 10-12 | 30-50 | Full points if in range |
| Default (no persona) | 7-8 | 60-70 | Current scoring unchanged |

Content clarity is the #2 factor for AI citation probability (+32.83%
score differential). Average US adult reads at 7th-8th grade level.

#### SEO Optimization (25 points)
| Check | Points | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Heading hierarchy with keywords | 5 | H1 -> H2 -> H3, no skips, keyword in 2-3 headings |
| Title tag (40-60 chars, keyword, power word) | 4 | Front-loaded keyword, positive sentiment |
| Keyword placement/density | 4 | Natural integration, no stuffing, in first 100 words |
| Internal linking (3-10 contextual) | 4 | Descriptive anchor text, bidirectional |
| URL structure | 3 | Short, keyword-rich, no stop words, lowercase |
| Meta description (150-160 chars, stat) | 3 | Fact-dense, includes one statistic |
| External linking (tier 1-3) | 2 | 3-8 outbound links to authoritative sources |

#### E-E-A-T Signals (15 points)
| Check | Points | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Author attribution (named, with bio) | 4 | Real name, credentials, not sales pitch |
| Source citations (tier 1-3, inline) | 4 | 8+ unique stats, zero fabricated |
| Trust indicators | 4 | Contact page, about page, editorial policy |
| Experience signals | 3 | "When we tested...", original photos/data |

When scoring source citations under E-E-A-T, evaluate whether each public statistic carries the FLOW evidence triple: year anchor in prose, inline citation with publisher and title, URL with retrieval date in the source block. Posts that cite tier 1-3 sources but lack retrieval dates score lower on this subcategory than posts that include the full triple. See `skills/blog/references/flow-alignment.md` for the standard.

#### Technical Elements (15 points)
| Check | Points | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Schema markup (3+ types = bonus) | 4 | BlogPosting + FAQ + Person minimum |
| Image optimization | 3 | AVIF/WebP, descriptive alt text, lazy except LCP |
| Structured data elements | 2 | Tables, lists, comparison blocks |
| Page speed signals | 2 | LCP < 2.5s, no render-blocking JS |
| Mobile-friendliness | 2 | Responsive, tap targets 48px+ |
| OG/social meta tags | 2 | og:title, og:description, og:image, twitter:card |

#### AI Citation Readiness (15 points)
| Check | Points | Pass Criteria |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Passage-level citability (120-180 words) | 4 | Self-contained sections with stat + source |
| Q&A formatted sections | 3 | 60-70% of H2s as questions, FAQ present |
| Entity clarity | 3 | Unambiguous topic entity, consistent terminology |
| Content structure for extraction | 3 | Answer-first, tables with thead, comparison formats |
| AI crawler accessibility | 2 | SSR/SSG, no JS-gated content |

### Step 3: AI Content Detection

Analyze the post for AI-generated content risk:

**Burstiness Score** (sentence length variance):
- Calculate standard deviation of sentence lengths across the post
- Human writing: high variance (short punchy + long complex sentences)
- AI writing: low variance (consistently medium-length sentences)
- Score: 0-10 scale (10 = very human-like burstiness)

**Known AI Phrase Detection**: flag occurrences of these 17 phrases:
1. "It's important to note"
2. "In today's digital landscape"
3. "Delve into"
4. "Navigating the complexities"
5. "Let's explore"
6. "Furthermore"
7. "In conclusion"
8. "It is worth mentioning"
9. "Embark on"
10. "Cutting-edge"
11. "Leverage" (as a verb, non-financial context)
12. "Game-changer"
13. "Revolutionize"
14. "Streamline"
15. "Harness the power"
16. "Dive deep"
17. "Unlock the potential"
18. Em dashes (-) - count all instances, flag as AI writing pattern

**Vocabulary Diversity** (Type-Token Ratio):
- Calculate unique words / total words
- Human writing: TTR typically 0.4-0.6 for long-form
- AI writing: TTR often below 0.35 (repetitive vocabulary)

**AI Content Risk Assessment**:
- Flag if AI probability > 50% based on combined signals
- Provide specific passages that triggered the flag
- Recommend humanization: personal anecdotes, varied sentence rhythm, domain jargon

### Step 4: Determine Rating

| Score | Rating | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 90-100 | Exceptional | Publish as-is, flagship content |
| 80-89 | Strong | Minor polish, ready for publication |
| 70-79 | Acceptable | Targeted improvements needed |
| 60-69 | Below Standard | Significant rework required |
| < 60 | Rewrite | Fundamental issues, start from outline |

### Step 4.5: Optional Ordinal Rubric (--rubric)

When `--rubric` is passed, additionally score the post on the 10 editorial heuristics defined in `skills/blog/references/editorial-heuristics.md`. Each heuristic gets a 0-4 score and a severity tag (P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 / none).

The rubric does NOT replace the 100-point score. It runs alongside and surfaces which findings are blocking versus which are polish.

Output the rubric as either:
- Markdown table (default) appended to the main report under a `### Editorial Heuristics Rubric` heading.
- JSON `rubric` field when `--format json` is in use.

Rubric JSON schema:
```json
{
  "rubric": {
    "heuristics": [
      { "id": 1, "name": "Visibility of intent", "score": 3, "severity": "P2", "note": "Summary box generic" },
      ...
    ],
    "p0_count": 0,
    "p1_count": 1,
    "p2_count": 2,
    "p3_count": 3
  }
}
```

### Step 4.6: Optional Cognitive Load Heatmap (--cognitive-load)

When `--cognitive-load` is passed, run `scripts/cognitive_load.py <file> --format json` and embed the result under a `cognitive_load` field in JSON output, or append a `### Cognitive Load Heatmap` markdown section in markdown output. See `skills/blog/references/cognitive-load.md` for thresholds and interpretation.

### Step 5: Generate Report

Default output format (Markdown):

```
