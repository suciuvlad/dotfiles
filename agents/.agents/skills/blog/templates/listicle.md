# Template: Listicle

**Template Name:** Listicle (Ranked/Numbered List)
**Target Word Count:** 1,500-2,000 words
**Description:** A curated, opinionated list of tools, resources, strategies, or options ranked by quality or relevance. Each item gets a concise evaluation with clear "best for" positioning. Designed to rank for "best [X]" and "[N] top [Y]" queries, capture comparison traffic, and earn featured snippets for list-format results.

## When to Use This Template

- **Content Goals:** Capture high-volume "best of" search queries, provide quick decision-making support, drive affiliate or referral traffic, establish curation authority
- **Search Intent:** Commercial investigation: the reader is evaluating options and wants an expert-curated shortlist
- **Best For:** Tool roundups, resource collections, strategy compilations, product recommendations, tip collections
- **Avoid When:** The topic requires deep analysis of only 1-2 options (use the Comparison template instead) or the items cannot be meaningfully ranked or differentiated

## Section-by-Section Structure

---

### Title (H1)

**Format:** "[N] Best [Things] for [Purpose] in [Year]"

**Examples:**
- "9 Best Static Site Generators for Developer Blogs in 2026"
- "7 Best Free CI/CD Tools for Small Teams in 2026"
- "12 Best VS Code Extensions for Python Development in 2026"

**Rules:**
- Use an odd or specific number (7, 9, 11): they outperform round numbers in CTR
- Include the primary keyword and target audience
- Include the year for freshness signals
- Keep under 60 characters if possible

---

### Introduction (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Open with the single most important market statistic or data point that explains *why* this category matters right now. Not "there are many options": a specific number that creates urgency.

**Structure:**
1. **Market context** (1-2 sentences): Why this category is relevant now. What changed?
2. **The problem** (1 sentence): Why choosing is hard (too many options, misleading marketing, hidden costs, etc.)
3. **Selection criteria anchor** (1-2 sentences): How you selected and ranked these items. Be specific about your methodology.
4. **Promise** (1 sentence): What the reader will walk away with.

[STAT: Market size, growth rate, or adoption statistic for this category]

[INFO-GAIN: selection methodology] Briefly explain your unique evaluation criteria: what did you weight most heavily and why? This differentiates you from every other listicle.

**Example opening:**
> "[STAT: The static site generator market grew 340% between 2023 and 2025 (Source).] With over 50 SSGs now available, choosing the right one can waste weeks on migrations you'll regret. We evaluated 23 generators across build speed, plugin ecosystem, and learning curve: testing each with a real 500-page documentation site. Here are the 9 that actually delivered."

### Item 1: [Item Name] - Best Overall / Best for [Primary Use Case] (150-200 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Open with the single strongest reason this item earned its ranking position. Lead with the differentiator, not the description.

**Structure for EVERY item section:**

**H2 format:** `## 1. [Item Name] - Best for [Specific Use Case]`

1. **Lead differentiator** (1 sentence): The single strongest reason to choose this item.
2. **Why it's great** (2-3 sentences): Key strengths with specific details (not marketing copy).
3. **Best for** (1 sentence): The specific persona or use case where this item excels.
4. **Key feature highlight** (1-2 sentences): One standout feature explained with enough detail to be useful.
5. **Pricing** (1 sentence): Clear pricing info: free tier, starting price, per-seat cost, etc.

[IMAGE] Product screenshot, logo, or UI screenshot showing the key feature in action.

[INFO-GAIN: hands-on observation] Share one specific thing you noticed during testing that isn't mentioned on the product's marketing page.

[STAT: Performance metric, user count, or benchmark result for this item]

**Example:**
> ## 1. Astro - Best for Content-Heavy Sites
>
> Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, which means your content-heavy site loads faster than anything else on this list: our 500-page test site scored 100/100 on Lighthouse without any optimization.
>
> **Why it's great:** The "islands" architecture lets you sprinkle interactivity only where needed. The content collections API makes managing hundreds of Markdown files trivial. And the ecosystem hit 800+ integrations in early 2026.
>
> **Best for:** Documentation sites, blogs, marketing pages, and any project where content volume matters more than app-like interactivity.
>
> **Key feature:** Content Collections provide type-safe frontmatter validation: catch broken posts at build time, not in production.
>
> **Pricing:** Free and open source. Astro Studio (optional hosting) starts at $0/month with generous free tier.

### Items 6-N: [Continue as needed] (150-200 words each)

[Follow the same structure for each additional item. Aim for 7-12 items total depending on the category depth.]

**Note:** Every item must earn its spot. If you can't write 150 meaningful words about an item, it doesn't belong on the list. Padding with filler items destroys credibility.

---

### Comparison Table (Feature Matrix)

[VISUAL: comparison-table]

**Format:** A markdown table comparing all items across 5-7 key dimensions.

**Required columns:**
| Tool | Best For | Pricing | [Key Metric 1] | [Key Metric 2] | [Key Metric 3] | Rating |
|------|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|

**Rules:**
- Use consistent units across all items
- Include pricing tiers (Free / $X/mo / Custom)
- Use specific values, not vague ratings (e.g., "2.3s build time" not "Fast")
- Bold the winner in each column
- Place this table after all item descriptions so readers who scroll get the summary

[INFO-GAIN: original benchmark data] If you ran your own tests, include your methodology and raw numbers. This is the highest-value info-gain opportunity in the entire post.

---

### How We Selected These (100-150 words)

[ANSWER-FIRST] Open with the total number of options you evaluated and the primary elimination criterion.

**Structure:**
1. **Scope** (1 sentence): How many options you started with.
2. **Evaluation criteria** (bulleted list): 3-5 specific criteria with brief explanations.
3. **Testing methodology** (1-2 sentences): What you actually did to test (not just "we researched").
4. **Disclosure** (1 sentence): Any affiliations, sponsorships, or biases the reader should know about.

[INFO-GAIN: testing process] Describe your actual testing methodology: what did you build, measure, or try with each item?

[STAT: Total evaluation scope (e.g. "We tested [N] tools over [X] weeks")]

**Example:**
> We started with 23 static site generators identified from GitHub trending, community surveys, and our own reader requests. Each was evaluated against five criteria:
> - **Build performance**: Time to build a 500-page test site
> - **Developer experience**: Setup time, documentation quality, error messages
> - **Ecosystem maturity**: Plugin count, community activity, corporate backing
> - **Content authoring**: Markdown support, CMS integration, media handling
> - **Deployment flexibility**: Where and how easily it deploys
>
> Testing took 4 weeks with a standardized 500-page documentation site benchmark. No item on this list paid for placement.

### Frequently Asked Questions (3-5 questions)

[FAQ]

**Format:** Each question as an H3, answer in 2-4 sentences.

**Question selection criteria:**
1. "What is the best [X] overall?" (Restate your top pick with reasoning)
2. "Is [popular free option] good enough?" (Address the budget-conscious reader)
3. "What's the difference between [A] and [B]?" (Address the most common head-to-head confusion)
4. "[Category]-specific question" (Address a domain-specific concern, e.g., "Do I need a paid [X] for production?")
5. "How often does this list get updated?" (Build trust around freshness)

[STAT: Include at least one statistic in your FAQ answers]

**Example:**

#### What is the best static site generator in 2026?

[2-4 sentence answer naming the top pick, primary reason, and caveat about use case fit.]

#### Is [Free Option] good enough for production?

[2-4 sentence answer with honest assessment and specific limitations.]

#### What's the difference between [A] and [B]?

[2-4 sentence answer with the single clearest differentiator.]

### Conclusion with Top Pick Recommendation (50-100 words)

**Structure:**
1. **Top pick restatement** (1 sentence): Name the overall winner and the single biggest reason.
2. **Runner-up for different need** (1 sentence): Name the best alternative for a different use case.
3. **Decision framework** (1 sentence): Give the reader a simple rule for choosing ("If you need [X], go with [A]. If you need [Y], go with [B].").
4. **CTA** (1 sentence): Ask for engagement: "What's your pick? Share in the comments" or "Subscribe for our next roundup."
