{
  [configuration with inline comments]
}
\`\`\`

[IMAGE: screenshot of setup completion / expected terminal output]

### Step-by-Step Sections (300-400 words each, 4-6 steps)

Each step is an H2 heading. Follow this structure for every step:

```markdown
## Step [N]: [Action Verb] + [What You're Doing]

[ANSWER-FIRST] In this step, you'll [what this step accomplishes] so that [why it matters for the final outcome].

[Brief explanation of the concept behind this step - 2-3 sentences max]

\`\`\`[language]
// [filename where this code goes]

[code block with detailed inline comments]

// [Explain non-obvious lines]
\`\`\`

[IMAGE: screenshot showing the result of this step]

**What just happened:** [1-2 sentence explanation of what the code does]

**Expected output:**

\`\`\`
[terminal output or browser result]
