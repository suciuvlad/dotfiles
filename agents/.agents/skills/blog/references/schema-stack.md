## Why Schema Matters

72% of first-page results use structured data markup. Pages using 3+ schema
types have approximately 13% higher likelihood of AI citation. Schema must
appear in HTML source: not injected via JavaScript: because most AI crawlers
do not execute JS.

## BlogPosting Schema

The primary schema for every blog post. Embeds author, publisher, and article
metadata in a single structured entity.

## BreadcrumbList Schema

Provides navigation hierarchy to search engines and AI systems. Improves
how pages appear in search results and helps crawlers understand site structure.

### ItemListElement Pattern

Each breadcrumb item requires `@type`, `position`, `name`, and `item` (URL).

### Complete BreadcrumbList Example

```json
{
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://example.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Blog",
      "item": "https://example.com/blog"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "SEO",
      "item": "https://example.com/blog/category/seo"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 4,
      "name": "Complete Guide to Technical SEO in 2026",
      "item": "https://example.com/blog/technical-seo-guide"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Rules

- Always start with Home (position 1)
- Include category/topic level if applicable
- Final item is the current page
- Positions must be sequential integers starting at 1
- Every item except the last must have an `item` URL

---

## FAQPage Schema

**Important**: Since August 2023, Google restricted FAQ rich results to government and health
authority websites only. For all other sites, **no FAQ rich results will appear in Google
Search** - the markup produces no visual search enhancement.

However, the markup is still worth including for AI citation reasons: LLMs parse your page's
**visible FAQ text** (not the JSON-LD) and Q&A-formatted content improves extractability for
citation. Google says there is "no need to proactively remove" existing FAQPage markup and it
"does not cause problems for Search." Implement for AI citation value, not rich results.

### Structure

```
FAQPage
  └── mainEntity (array)
        └── Question
              ├── name (the question text)
              └── acceptedAnswer
                    └── Answer
                          └── text (the answer text, 40-60 words)
```

### Complete FAQPage Example

```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How does technical SEO affect AI visibility?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Technical SEO directly determines whether AI crawlers can access and extract your content. Since AI crawlers do not execute JavaScript, server-side rendered HTML with structured data markup is essential. Sites with proper technical SEO and accessible content structure are significantly more likely to earn AI citations."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is the most important schema type for blog posts?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "BlogPosting schema is the foundation for blog content. It provides structured metadata about the article including author, dates, and content classification. Combined with Person and Organization schemas, it creates a complete entity graph that search engines and AI systems use to evaluate content authority."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "Do AI search engines use schema markup?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. AI search engines like ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews use schema markup to identify authoritative content. Pages with 3 or more schema types have approximately 13% higher likelihood of being cited in AI-generated responses compared to pages without structured data."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Guidelines

- 3-5 FAQ items per page (not excessive)
- Answers should be 40-60 words (concise, extractable)
- Questions should match real user queries (People Also Ask style)
- Do not duplicate content already in the main article body
- Each answer should be self-contained and useful without context

---

## ImageObject Schema

Used within BlogPosting for featured images and inline article images.

### Properties

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `@type` | Yes | String | `"ImageObject"` |
| `url` | Yes | URL | Full image URL |
| `width` | Yes | Integer | Width in pixels |
| `height` | Yes | Integer | Height in pixels |
| `caption` | Recommended | String | Descriptive caption |
| `creditText` | Recommended | String | Photographer or source credit |
| `copyrightHolder` | Optional | Person/Organization | Rights holder |
| `license` | Optional | URL | Link to license (e.g., Creative Commons) |

### Complete ImageObject Example

```json
{
  "@type": "ImageObject",
  "url": "https://example.com/images/blog/seo-workflow-diagram.jpg",
  "width": 1200,
  "height": 630,
  "caption": "Technical SEO audit workflow showing the 7-step process from crawl analysis to implementation",
  "creditText": "Example Corp Design Team",
  "copyrightHolder": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Example Corp"
  }
}
```

## VideoObject Schema

Used for YouTube videos embedded in blog posts. YouTube has the strongest
AI visibility correlation (0.737). Each embedded video gets its own VideoObject.

### Properties

| Property | Required | Type | Description |
|----------|----------|------|-------------|
| `@type` | Yes | String | `"VideoObject"` |
| `@id` | Yes | URI | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}#video-{index}` |
| `name` | Yes | String | Video title |
| `description` | Yes | String | First 200 chars of video description |
| `thumbnailUrl` | Yes | URL | `https://img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/hqdefault.jpg` |
| `uploadDate` | Yes | ISO 8601 | Video publish date |
| `contentUrl` | Yes | URL | `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={id}` |
| `embedUrl` | Yes | URL | `https://www.youtube.com/embed/{id}` |
| `duration` | Recommended | ISO 8601 | Duration (e.g., `PT10M30S`) |
| `interactionStatistic` | Recommended | InteractionCounter | View count |
| `publisher` | Optional | Organization | Channel name and URL |

### Complete VideoObject Example

```json
{
  "@type": "VideoObject",
  "@id": "https://example.com/blog/seo-guide#video-1",
  "name": "Complete Guide to Technical SEO in 2026",
  "description": "Learn the essential technical SEO strategies for 2026 including Core Web Vitals optimization, structured data, and AI search readiness.",
  "thumbnailUrl": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/dQw4w9WgXcQ/hqdefault.jpg",
  "uploadDate": "2026-01-20T00:00:00Z",
  "contentUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "duration": "PT12M45S",
  "interactionStatistic": {
    "@type": "InteractionCounter",
    "interactionType": { "@type": "WatchAction" },
    "userInteractionCount": 25000
  }
}
```

### Guidelines

- Only generate for YouTube videos actually embedded in the post
- Use `#video-1`, `#video-2` for sequential @id fragments
- Duration must be ISO 8601 format (PT prefix, M for minutes, S for seconds)
- Extract metadata from embed noscript text or YouTube Data API

---

## Speakable Schema

Optimizes content for voice search and voice assistants (Google Assistant,
Siri, Alexa). Identifies which sections of a page are most suitable for
text-to-speech playback.

### Implementation Options

Use `cssSelector` (preferred) or `xPath` to identify speakable content sections.

### Speakable Example with CSS Selectors

```json
{
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "cssSelector": [
      ".article-summary",
      ".faq-answer",
      "h1",
      ".key-takeaway"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Speakable Example with XPath

```json
{
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "speakable": {
    "@type": "SpeakableSpecification",
    "xPath": [
      "/html/head/title",
      "/html/body//article/p[1]",
      "/html/body//div[@class='key-takeaway']"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Guidelines

- Point to concise, self-contained text sections
- Ideal sections: article summaries, FAQ answers, key takeaways
- Avoid pointing to entire articles (too long for voice)
- Each speakable section should be under 2-3 sentences
- Content must make sense when read aloud without visual context

---

## Stable @id Patterns

Every schema entity needs a stable, unique `@id` that remains consistent across
page loads and site rebuilds. This allows search engines to build entity graphs
and AI systems to deduplicate references.

### Standard Patterns

| Entity | @id Pattern | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Blog Post | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}#article` | `https://example.com/blog/seo-guide#article` |
| Author | `{siteUrl}/author/{slug}#person` | `https://example.com/author/sarah-chen#person` |
| Organization | `{siteUrl}#organization` | `https://example.com#organization` |
| WebPage | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}` | `https://example.com/blog/seo-guide` |
| BreadcrumbList | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}#breadcrumb` | `https://example.com/blog/seo-guide#breadcrumb` |
| FAQPage | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}#faq` | `https://example.com/blog/seo-guide#faq` |
| VideoObject | `{siteUrl}/blog/{slug}#video-{N}` | `https://example.com/blog/seo-guide#video-1` |

### Rules

- Use the fragment identifier (`#`) to differentiate entities on the same page
- Never use random IDs, timestamps, or build hashes
- Keep patterns consistent across every page on the site
- The URL portion must match the canonical URL
- Use `@id` references to link entities instead of embedding duplicates

### Referencing by @id

Instead of embedding a full Person object in every BlogPosting, reference the
@id and define the Person once in the @graph:

```json
"author": {
  "@id": "https://example.com/author/sarah-chen#person"
}
```

---

## Deprecated Schema Types: NEVER Use

These types have been deprecated by Google. Using them does not cause penalties
but wastes implementation effort and may trigger rich result validation warnings.

| Type | Deprecated | Date | Notes |
|------|------------|------|-------|
| HowTo | Yes | September 2023 | Rich results removed entirely |
| SpecialAnnouncement | Yes | July 2025 | COVID-era, no longer processed |
| ClaimReview | Yes | June 2025 | Google structured data simplification; no longer generates rich results |
| Practice Problem | Yes |: | Educational, no longer generates rich results |
| Dataset | Yes |: | For general search; still works in Google Dataset Search |
| Sitelinks Search Box | Yes |: | Google generates these algorithmically now |
| Q&A | Yes | January 2026 | Replaced by community forum features |

### What to Use Instead

| Deprecated Type | Alternative |
|----------------|-------------|
| HowTo | Use standard BlogPosting with clear step headings (H2/H3) |
| Q&A | Use FAQPage for editorial Q&A; no replacement for community Q&A |
| SpecialAnnouncement | Use standard Article or NewsArticle |
| ClaimReview | No direct replacement for blogs; use Author entity with credentials |

---

## ProfilePage Schema (Author Pages)

Fully supported since December 2025. Add to author bio/team pages to strengthen E-E-A-T
signals and improve eligibility for the "Discussions and Forums" SERP feature.

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "ProfilePage",
  "dateCreated": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "dateModified": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z",
  "mainEntity": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "@id": "https://example.com/author/jane-smith#person",
    "name": "Jane Smith",
    "url": "https://example.com/author/jane-smith",
    "jobTitle": "Senior Content Strategist",
    "description": "Jane writes about SEO and content marketing with 8 years of experience.",
    "image": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://example.com/images/jane-smith.jpg"
    },
    "sameAs": [
      "https://linkedin.com/in/janesmith",
      "https://twitter.com/janesmith"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## JSON-LD @graph Pattern

Combine all schema entities in a single `<script type="application/ld+json">`
tag using the `@graph` array. This is the recommended approach for pages with
multiple schema types.

### Benefits

- Single script tag instead of multiple scattered blocks
- Entities reference each other via `@id`
- Easier to maintain and validate
- Cleaner HTML source

### Complete @graph Example (Blog Post Page)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@graph": [
    {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "@id": "https://example.com#organization",
      "name": "Example Corp",
      "url": "https://example.com",
