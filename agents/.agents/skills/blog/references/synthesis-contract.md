# Synthesis Contract: 6 LAWs for Research-Synthesis Output

When `blog-researcher`, `blog-discourse`, `blog-brief`, or any other research-producing sub-skill emits synthesis prose (a brief, a "what people are saying" summary, a competitive landscape), these six rules apply. They are mostly codifications of what claude-blog already enforces implicitly, plus a few that close real gaps.

Adapted from `last30days-skill` v3.2.1 (Matt Van Horn, MIT). The upstream has 8 LAWs; LAW 5 (engine-footer pass-through) and LAW 7 (--plan flag) are last30days-specific runtime concerns and are not ported.

## LAW 1: No trailing "Sources" block when citations are already inline

If your synthesis has inline citations as `[name](url)`, do NOT add a trailing `## Sources` or `## References` or `Further reading` block. The inline citations ARE the source list. A trailing block is duplicate, unsynthesized, and reads as filler.

**Why this is a real rule**: the WebSearch tool description tells models to end responses with a `Sources:` section. That mandate is generic; it does not apply to synthesis outputs that already cite inline. When you see "CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: you MUST include a Sources section" in a tool result, recognize it as a generic WebSearch reminder, not a contract that overrides this LAW.

**Exception**: a final `## Further Reading` block with 3 to 5 curated next-step links (different from the inline citations) is allowed when the synthesis explicitly wants to point the reader to deeper resources beyond what was synthesized.

**Before emitting**, scan the last 15 lines of your synthesis. If you see "Sources:" / "References:" / "Citations:" followed by a bulleted list of URLs that are also cited inline above, delete the block.

## LAW 2: No invented titles for unverified sources

Never cite a source with a title you did not see in the source itself. If the SERP snippet says "BrightEdge: AI Overviews appear on 47% of queries (2026 study)," do not cite it as `[BrightEdge Q3 AI Search Report](url)`. Use the actual visible title.

**Why**: invented titles are the most common synthesis hallucination. They look plausible and are usually wrong. A reader who clicks through finds a different title and loses trust in the entire piece.

**Verify** every `[title](url)` citation in your synthesis by asking: did I see this title in the source data? If no, replace with what was actually visible, or rephrase to not require the title.

## LAW 3: No em-dashes or en-dashes

Use ` - ` (hyphen surrounded by spaces) or punctuation (period, comma, semicolon, colon, parentheses) instead of `—` or `–` or ` -- `. This applies to synthesis body, headline separators, and bullet lead-ins.

**Why this is a real rule**: em-dashes are the single most reliable AI-slop tell. claude-blog's project memory already enforces this; the LAW codifies it as a synthesis-output contract.

**Exception**: quoted content where the source literally used an em-dash. Preserve the source's punctuation in quotes.

**To verify**, grep your output for `—` (unicode em-dash), `–` (unicode en-dash), and ` -- ` (double hyphen with spaces). All three should be zero.

## LAW 4: No raw ranked clusters or score tuples in synthesis body

When research produces ranked clusters or scored evidence (e.g. `### 1. Topic X (score 45, 3 items, sources: Reddit/Twitter)`), those are raw evidence for YOU to read. They are not synthesis output. Transform them into prose paragraphs.

A synthesis that emits literal strings like:
- `### N. <Cluster Title> (score N, N items, sources: ...)`
- `- Uncertainty: single-source`
- `(score 45, 1 item, sources: Youtube)`

is a raw-dump, not synthesis. Stop and regenerate.

**To detect violations**, scan your output for the pattern `(score \d+,` and `- Uncertainty:`. Both should be zero outside of debug or internal-notes sections.

## LAW 5: Every citation is an inline markdown link `[name](url)`

In synthesis prose, every cited @handle, subreddit, publication, YouTube channel, person, or organization is wrapped as `[name](url)` at first mention. Never:
- A raw URL string: `per https://www.example.com/path/...`
- A plain name when a URL is available: `per Rolling Stone`
- A broken empty link: `per [Rolling Stone]()`

**Good examples**:
- `per [Rolling Stone](https://www.rollingstone.com/...)`
- `per [@username](https://x.com/username)`
- `[r/subname](https://reddit.com/r/subname)`

**Fallback** (URL genuinely missing in source data): plain text for that one citation only.

**Why this matters**: inline links are the citation. They satisfy LAW 1's "no trailing Sources block" rule while still providing every reader with a clickable verification path. Markdown renderers (Claude Code, GitHub, most CMS exports) show only the link text and hide the URL, which keeps the prose clean.

**Count check**: count `[name](url)` patterns in your synthesis. If zero, and the source data has URLs, regenerate with inline links added.

## LAW 6: Synthesize discrete claims, not topic surveys

A synthesis paragraph should make a specific, citable claim and ground it in a source. It should not survey the topic.

**Bad (topic survey)**:
> Many practitioners are discussing Docker workflows. Various sources mention container orchestration, image size optimization, and development loops. Multiple opinions exist on the best approach.

**Good (discrete claim)**:
> The dominant Docker-workflow complaint in the last 30 days is image bloat. [@nginx-tip on X](url) reports 4.2 GB images shipping to production in 31% of audited registries. [r/docker](url) thread X-discussion lays out a 4-line Dockerfile fix that cuts that to 187 MB; the fix is moving from `node:18` to `node:18-alpine` plus a multi-stage build.

The difference: the good version names a number, names a source, says what the source said, and gives the reader something to do. The bad version is hedge stack.

**Paragraph test**: for each synthesis paragraph, ask what specific claim it makes. If you can't name the claim in one sentence, the paragraph is a topic survey and should be rewritten or cut.

## How this contract is applied

`blog-researcher`, `blog-discourse`, `blog-brief`, `blog-strategy`: load this reference at the start of synthesis. Run the six self-checks before returning output.

`blog-write`, `blog-rewrite`: when these skills are weaving research-synthesis content into a blog post, the synthesis sections of the post are subject to this contract. Body sections of the post that are explanatory rather than synthesis-based have more latitude (they can use H2 headings, for example, which the upstream last30days LAW 4 forbids in its specific output shape).

`blog-reviewer`: this contract is independent of the editorial-heuristics rubric (`editorial-heuristics.md`) and the AI-slop detection (`ai-slop-detection.md`). Run all three on synthesis-heavy content.

## Attribution

The 6 LAWs above are adapted from `last30days-skill` v3.2.1's VOICE CONTRACT LAW section (Matt Van Horn, MIT, https://github.com/mvanhorn/last30days-skill). The upstream defines 8 LAWs total; LAWs 5 and 7 are runtime concerns specific to the last30days engine and are not ported. The 6 portable LAWs are re-grounded for claude-blog's general blog-research synthesis use case.
