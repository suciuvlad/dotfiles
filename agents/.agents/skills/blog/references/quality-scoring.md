## Quick Automated Checks

These can be detected programmatically:

### Content Quality
1. Word count per paragraph (split on double newlines, flag > 150, critical > 200)
2. Sentence count per paragraph (flag > 3 sentences)
3. Flesch-Kincaid score (target 60-70, acceptable 55-75)
4. Heading frequency (flag gaps > 300 words between H2s)
5. TL;DR box presence (search for "TL;DR" in first 500 characters)
6. Average sentence length (target 15-20, flag > 22)
7. Sentences over 20 words (flag if > 25% of total)
8. Passive voice percentage (flag > 10%, high priority > 15%)
9. AI trigger word density (flag > 5 per 1,000 words)
10. Transition word percentage (target 20-30%, flag < 15% or > 35%)

### SEO Optimization
11. Title tag length (frontmatter, target 40-60 chars)
12. Heading hierarchy (regex for `^#{1,6} `, no skipped levels)
13. Meta description length (frontmatter, target 150-160 chars)
14. Internal link count (regex for relative URLs or same-domain links)
15. External link count and tier classification
16. URL structure check (lowercase, no stop words)

### E-E-A-T Signals
17. Author attribution presence (frontmatter `author` field)
18. Citation format (regex for `\([^)]+\(http`)
19. Unsourced statistics (numbers without attribution nearby)
20. Self-promotion patterns (brand name frequency, max 1)
21. First-person markers ("we tested", "in our experience")

### Technical Elements
22. Image count (regex for `!\[` or `<img`)
23. Image alt text presence (images without alt attribute)
24. Chart count (regex for `<svg` or `<figure`)
25. Schema presence (search for structured data markers)
26. OG meta tags (frontmatter `ogImage`, `coverImage`)
27. `loading="lazy"` on first image (flag as LCP issue)
28. lastUpdated presence (frontmatter check)

### AI Citation Readiness
29. Section word count between headings (target 120-180)
30. Question-format heading ratio (target 60-70% of H2s)
31. FAQ presence (search for "FAQ" or "Frequently Asked")
32. Table presence with `<thead>` (for AI extraction)
33. robots.txt AI bot allowance (site-level check)
