# FLOW Framework for Bloggers (Find, Optimize, Win)

> Framework and prompts (c) Daniel Agrici, CC BY 4.0. Source: github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow

FLOW is an evidence-led operating model built for the AI-search era. Claude Blog
integrates the FLOW prompt library so writers can drive their workflow with
structured, source-backed AI prompts instead of improvised queries.

This skill exposes the three blog-relevant stages (Find, Optimize, Win) and keeps
the single Leverage prompt available through the prompts index. The local-SEO
prompts (GBP, citations, local audits) are intentionally excluded because they
target brick-and-mortar work, not blogs.

**Runtime context.** Load `references/flow-framework.md` on every `/blog flow`
activation. Load prompt files on demand only, scoped to the stage the user
requests.

---

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/blog flow` | Show FLOW overview and stage menu |
| `/blog flow find [topic\|url]` | Find-stage: keyword discovery, intent mapping, gap analysis (5 prompts) |
| `/blog flow optimize [url]` | Optimize-stage: select 2 to 3 most relevant prompts of 21 based on context |
| `/blog flow win [url]` | Win-stage: BOFU, conversion, dual-surface scorecard (3 prompts) |
| `/blog flow prompts` | Full index of all 30 blog-applicable prompts (Find, Leverage, Optimize, Win) |
| `/blog flow sync` | Pull latest prompt files from github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow |

The single Leverage prompt (off-site authority) is reachable through
`/blog flow prompts` and is not promoted to a top-level command, since most
blog workflows route off-site work elsewhere.

---

## Orchestration Logic

### On `/blog flow` (no sub-command)
1. Read `references/flow-framework.md`.
2. Show the FLOW stage overview with a one-line description of each stage.
3. Ask the user which stage matches their current situation.

### On `/blog flow find [topic|url]`
1. Read all files in `references/prompts/find/`.
2. Apply each prompt to the topic or URL, capturing demand and intent signals.
3. Cross-reference: "For deeper briefs and outlines, see `/blog brief <topic>`,
   `/blog outline <topic>`, and `/blog cannibalization` to detect overlap with
   existing posts."

### On `/blog flow optimize [url]`
1. Read the file names in `references/prompts/optimize/`.
2. Read prior context (target URL, niche, any prior skill output in this
   conversation, scoring deltas from `/blog analyze`).
3. Select 2 to 3 most relevant prompts, then load only those files.
4. Apply the selected prompts; note that the rest are accessible via
   `/blog flow prompts`.
5. Cross-reference: "For deeper rewrites and validation, see `/blog rewrite
   <file>`, `/blog seo-check <file>`, `/blog geo <file>`, `/blog schema <file>`,
   and `/blog factcheck <file>`."

### On `/blog flow win [url]`
1. Read all files in `references/prompts/win/`.
2. Apply each prompt to the URL's conversion and BOFU context.
3. Cross-reference: "For repurposing, full-site health, and quality scoring,
   see `/blog repurpose <file>`, `/blog audit`, and `/blog analyze <file>`."

### On `/blog flow prompts`
1. Read `references/prompts/README.md`.
2. Display the full index: 30 prompts grouped by stage (Find, Leverage,
   Optimize, Win) with name and trigger conditions.
3. State that local-SEO prompts are excluded by design; point users to
   `claude-seo` (`/seo flow local`) if they need them.

### On `/blog flow sync`
1. Run: `python3 scripts/sync_flow.py`.
2. Display the JSON summary (files added, updated, unchanged).
3. Show the attribution notice after the sync completes.

## Context Matching (Optimize stage)

The optimize stage has 21 prompts. Dumping all 21 is noise. Select by priority:

1. **Niche** (SaaS or B2B blog leans on-page plus technical; lifestyle leans
   freshness plus E-E-A-T; publisher leans authority plus citations).
2. **Prior skill output** (`/blog analyze` E-E-A-T gap routes to authority
   prompts; `/blog seo-check` failures route to on-page prompts; `/blog geo`
   gaps route to extraction-format prompts).
3. **URL signals** (commercial pages need conversion prompts; informational
   posts need freshness plus answer-first prompts).

Always surface exactly 2 to 3 prompts. State which prompts you chose and why.

## Reference Files

Load on demand. Do NOT load all at startup.

- `references/flow-framework.md`. FLOW operating model. Load on every `/blog
  flow` activation.
- `references/bibliography.md`. Evidence sources. Load when citing studies or
  statistics.
- `references/prompts/README.md`. Prompt index. Load for `/blog flow prompts`.
- `references/prompts/find/`. 5 prompts. Load for `/blog flow find`.
- `references/prompts/leverage/`. 1 prompt. Load only when surfaced through
  `/blog flow prompts`.
- `references/prompts/optimize/`. 21 prompts. Load selectively for `/blog flow
  optimize`.
- `references/prompts/win/`. 3 prompts. Load for `/blog flow win`.

If `references/` is missing, instruct the user to run `/blog flow sync` first.

---

## Sync Script

`scripts/sync_flow.py` pulls prompt files from github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow and
writes them under `skills/blog-flow/references/`. Stdlib only, HTTPS only,
host-allowlisted to `api.github.com`, 5 MB response cap, atomic writes,
path-traversal guarded.

Modes:

- `python3 scripts/sync_flow.py`. Sync the latest version of every blog-relevant
  stage to disk and refresh the lockfile.
- `python3 scripts/sync_flow.py --dry-run`. Report planned changes without
  writing.
- `python3 scripts/sync_flow.py --ref <sha>`. Pin fetches to a specific FLOW
  commit SHA for reproducible installs.

The lockfile lives at
`skills/blog-flow/references/flow-prompts.lock` and uses sha256sum-compatible
format. Drift between the on-disk content and the lockfile is reported on every
sync run.

The script syncs only blog-applicable stages (`find`, `leverage`, `optimize`,
`win`). The `local` stage is intentionally skipped to keep the references
directory aligned with the skill's surface area.

GitHub API calls are anonymous by default. If `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in the
environment, or `gh auth token` returns a token after a 403 response, the
script retries the request with that token. No tokens are written to disk.

---

## Attribution

Every `/blog flow` activation (any sub-command) outputs before analysis:

```
Framework and prompts (c) Daniel Agrici, CC BY 4.0. Source: github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow
```

Do not omit or modify the attribution. Synced files also carry an HTML comment
license header injected by the sync script.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `references/flow-framework.md` missing | "FLOW reference files not synced. Run: `/blog flow sync`." |
| Prompt file missing | "Run `/blog flow sync` to pull the latest prompts from the FLOW repo." |
| `sync_flow.py` network error | Display the script's stderr. Check rate limits with `gh api rate_limit` if `gh` is installed. |
| `sync_flow.py` 403 after retry | Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` or run `gh auth login`, then retry. |
| Path-traversal abort | The sync target tried to escape the references directory. Inspect the upstream repo and pin to a known-good `--ref`. |
