# Tool Limitations

Every recommendation in this brain is advisory until verified against live data and Demo Growth Co's confirmation. Below are the known limitations of the tools the audit will rely on.

## claude-seo

- Optional audit skill/tool. Quality of the audit depends on Demo Growth Co configuring API access.
- Required: DataForSEO API key, [[Google Search Console]] OAuth, optionally PageSpeed Insights API.
- If no API access is configured, the audit falls back to qualitative checks (on-page review, structural inventory) and cannot quantify SERP position, search volume, or backlink profile.

## DataForSEO

- Paid API; per-call cost. Track in cost log.
- Returns SERP and keyword data — useful but not perfect.
- Sample sizes vary by locale. Some country-specific data is shallower than US data — keyword volumes for long-tail regional queries may be reported as 0 even when the query has real traffic.
- SERP data is a snapshot at the time of the call; positions move daily.
- Always preserve the SERP timestamp, location, language, device, and depth in the export.

## GSC

- 16-month rolling window only. Data older than 16 months is gone unless previously exported.
- **Sampled query data when traffic is high** — top queries are reported, long-tail "(other)" bucket can be material on a hobby site or any site with many low-volume queries.
- The "(other)" bucket is opaque; cannot be drilled into.
- URL Inspection API has daily quotas.
- Performance data lags by ~2-3 days.

## Ad Network / Monetization Analytics

- Proprietary metrics; not directly comparable to GA4 or GSC.
- Session and revenue attribution definitions differ from other analytics platforms.
- Useful for trend analysis; treat absolute numbers as platform-internal.

## AI Generation

- Cannot replace verifiable practice for niches whose moat is real experience.
- Using AI to write expertise-claiming copy is detectable and risks further [[Google Helpful Content System|HCU]] drag.
- AI is acceptable for: outlining, fact-checking against sources, draft polish on human-authored content, structured data generation.
- AI is NOT acceptable for: generating pillar pages, location guides, gear reviews, case studies, or anything that asserts experience.
- See [[What Not To Do]].

## This Brain

- Built before any audit data exists for https://www.example.com.
- Every page count, traffic figure, competitor name, and revenue number is TBD pending audit.
- Recommendations are strategic kernels, not operational instructions.
- Anything claimed here that is contradicted by live data must be updated — the brain is wrong, not the data.
