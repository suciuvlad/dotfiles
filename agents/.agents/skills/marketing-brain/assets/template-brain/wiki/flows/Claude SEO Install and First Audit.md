# Claude SEO Install and First Audit

First execution flow once [[Day 0 Measurement Access Gate]] passes. Three audit cycles before installing FLOW.

## Install

1. Choose an SEO audit layer: `claude-seo`, Codex SEO skills, Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, GSC exports, or another trusted crawler.
2. Confirm required API access and cost limits.
3. Save the audit output under `.raw/sources/audits/`.

## First Audit Run

1. Run the audit with the site URL `{{site_url}}`.
2. Let the crawl complete. Do not interrupt.
3. Save the report to `.raw/sources/audits/audit-1-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (substitute today's date).

## Triage The Findings

For every finding in the report, assign one of three labels:

- **Critical** — fix before next audit run. Likely contributors to algorithmic demotion, indexation issues, or E-E-A-T / disclosure gaps. Each Critical item gets either a content prune decision (if the fix is "remove or merge") or a technical fix entry (if the fix is "edit code, schema, or config").
- **Important** — fix during the sprint, scheduled into the relevant phase flow.
- **Nice-to-have** — log and defer. Do not let these consume sprint time.

## Repeat Pattern

Standard guidance: "run, fix, repeat at least 3 times."

- Audit 1: capture the full surface. Triage. Fix Critical items.
- Audit 2: re-crawl. Verify Critical items resolved. New issues triaged.
- Audit 3: re-crawl. Confirm stable surface before installing FLOW.

Save each audit report as `audit-N-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in `.raw/sources/audits/`.

## After 3 Audits

1. Install the [[FLOW Framework]] skill from `https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow`.
2. Run the strategy prompt — the exact wording lives in [[Start Here]].
3. The output of that prompt seeds the rest of the sprint and feeds into [[Days 1-5 GSC Diagnostic and Triage]].

## Acceptance

3 audit reports saved with date-stamped filenames. Every Critical finding has either a fix commit / config change or a documented deferral with rationale and owner. FLOW Framework installed and strategy prompt run.

## Rollback

Skills can be uninstalled from Claude with no site impact. Audit reports are read-only — they describe state, they do not change it. Any Critical fix that lands on the site itself follows the rollback path of its own phase flow.
