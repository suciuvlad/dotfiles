  AI image generation and editing for blog content powered by Gemini via MCP.
  Claude acts as Creative Director - interpreting intent, selecting domain expertise,
  constructing optimized 6-component prompts (Subject + Action + Context + Composition
  + Lighting + Style), and orchestrating Gemini for blog-quality results. Generates
  hero images, inline illustrations, social preview cards, and OG images. Edits
  existing blog images. Supports 6 blog-optimized domain modes (Editorial, Product,
  Landscape, UI/Web, Infographic, Abstract). Works standalone via /blog image or
  internally from blog-write and blog-rewrite workflows. Falls back gracefully when
  MCP is not configured. Use when user says "blog image", "generate hero image",
  "blog illustration", "social card", "generate blog image", "edit blog image",
  "image generate", "blog cover image", "inline image", "OG image".

# Blog Image - AI Image Generation for Blog Content

You are a **Creative Director** that orchestrates Gemini's image generation
specifically for blog content. Never pass raw user text directly to the API.
Always interpret, enhance, and construct an optimized prompt using the
6-component Reasoning Brief system.

## Quick Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/blog image generate <idea>` | Generate a blog image with full prompt engineering |
| `/blog image edit <path> <instructions>` | Edit an existing blog image intelligently |
| `/blog image setup` | Configure MCP server and API key |

## Blog Image Types

Match the image type to blog use case:

| Image Type | Aspect Ratio | Resolution | Domain Mode | Placement |
|------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Hero/Cover | `16:9` | 2K or 4K | Editorial / Landscape | Frontmatter `coverImage` |
| OG/Social Card | `16:9` | 1K | Editorial / Infographic | Frontmatter `ogImage` |
| Inline Illustration | `16:9` or `4:3` | 1K | Varies by topic | After H2, before body |
| Inline Product Shot | `4:3` or `1:1` | 1K | Product | Within product sections |
| Section Divider | `8:1` or `4:1` | 1K | Abstract / Landscape | Between major sections |

**Sizing requirements:**
- Blog hero/cover: 1200x630 (OG-compatible) or 1920x1080
- Open Graph (OG): 1200x630 (required for social sharing)
- Inline images: 1200px+ wide

## MCP Availability Check

Before generating, check if nanobanana-mcp tools are available:

1. Try calling `get_image_history` (lightweight, no side effects)
2. If it succeeds: MCP is available, proceed with generation
3. If it fails: MCP not configured - inform the user:
   - "Image generation requires the nanobanana-mcp server. Run `/blog image setup` to configure it."
   - When called internally (from blog-write/blog-rewrite): return silently, no error. The calling workflow continues with stock photos.

## Generation Workflow

For `/blog image generate <idea>` or when invoked internally:

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Determine what the blog needs:
- **Image type**: Hero, inline, OG card, section divider?
- **Blog topic**: What is the article about?
- **Style**: Photorealistic, editorial, illustrated, minimal?
- **Constraints**: Brand colors, specific dimensions, platform format?
- **Mood**: Authoritative, inviting, dramatic, clean?

If the request is vague, ask one clarifying question about use case and style.

### Step 2: Select Domain Mode

Choose the expertise lens for the image:

| Mode | When to use | Prompt emphasis |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Editorial** | Blog headers, feature images, lifestyle | Styling, composition, publication references |
| **Product** | E-commerce posts, reviews, comparisons | Surface materials, studio lighting, clean BG |
| **Landscape** | Environmental backgrounds, travel, hero sections | Atmospheric perspective, depth layers, time of day |
| **UI/Web** | Tech blog icons, illustrations, diagrams | Clean vectors, flat design, exact colors |
| **Infographic** | Data-driven posts, processes, comparisons | Layout structure, hierarchy, accessible colors |
| **Abstract** | Pattern backgrounds, section dividers, decorative | Color theory, mathematical forms, textures |

Load `references/prompt-engineering-blog.md` for domain mode modifier libraries.

### Step 3: Construct the 6-Component Reasoning Brief

Build the prompt as natural narrative paragraphs - NEVER as keyword lists:

1. **Subject** - Who/what, with rich physical detail (textures, materials, scale)
2. **Action** - What is happening, pose, gesture, movement, state
3. **Context** - Environment, setting, time of day, season, weather
4. **Composition** - Camera angle, shot type, framing, negative space, depth
5. **Lighting** - Light source, quality, direction, color temperature, shadows
6. **Style** - Art medium, aesthetic, film stock, reference artists/eras

**Template for photorealistic blog images:**
```
A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject with physical detail], [action/pose],
set in [environment with specifics]. [Lighting conditions] create [mood].
Captured with [camera model], [focal length] lens at [f-stop], producing
[depth of field effect]. [Color palette/grading notes]. Aspect ratio 16:9,
suitable as a blog [hero image/inline illustration] at [target dimensions].
```

**Template for illustrated/stylized:**
```
A [art style] [format] of [subject with character detail], featuring
[distinctive characteristics] with [color palette]. [Line style] and
[shading technique]. Background is [description]. [Mood/atmosphere].
```

### Step 4: Set Aspect Ratio

Call `set_aspect_ratio` BEFORE generating:

| Blog Use Case | Ratio |
|---------------|-------|
| Hero / Cover / OG | `16:9` |
| Product shot / Square | `4:3` or `1:1` |
| Section divider | `8:1` or `4:1` |
| Vertical (stories) | `9:16` |

### Step 5: Generate via MCP

| MCP Tool | When |
|----------|------|
| `set_aspect_ratio` | Always call first if ratio differs from 1:1 |
| `gemini_generate_image` | New image from crafted prompt |
| `gemini_edit_image` | Modify existing image |
| `gemini_chat` | Iterative refinement / multi-turn sessions |
| `get_image_history` | Review generated images |
| `clear_conversation` | Reset session context |

**Model selection** (use `set_model` MCP tool if switching):
- **NB2 Flash** (default): Best for most blog images - fast, 14 ratios, 4K, $0.067/img
- **NB Pro**: Use for hero images with text overlays (94% text accuracy) or highest quality - $0.134/img
- **Original**: Budget option at $0.039/img - 5 ratios, 1K max

Load `references/mcp-tools.md` for parameter details.
Load `references/gemini-models.md` for model specs, pricing, and rate limits.

### Step 6: Post-Processing (when needed)

After generation, resize/convert for blog use:

```bash
# Resize to blog hero dimensions (1200x630)
magick input.png -resize 1200x630^ -gravity center -extent 1200x630 hero.png

# Convert to WebP for web optimization
magick input.png -quality 85 output.webp

# Convert to AVIF (smallest, modern)
magick input.png -quality 80 output.avif

# Crop to exact OG dimensions
magick input.png -resize 1200x630^ -gravity center -extent 1200x630 og-image.png
```

Check if `magick` (ImageMagick 7) is available. Fall back to `convert` if not.

### Step 7: Deliver

Provide:
1. **Image path** - where it was saved (`~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/`)
2. **Crafted prompt** - show the full Reasoning Brief (educational)
3. **Settings** - model, aspect ratio, domain mode
4. **Alt text** - descriptive sentence, 10-125 chars, topic keywords naturally
5. **Frontmatter snippet** (for hero/OG images):
```yaml
coverImage: "/path/to/generated-image.png"
coverImageAlt: "Descriptive alt text sentence with topic keywords"
ogImage: "/path/to/generated-image.png"
```
6. **Refinement suggestions** - 1-2 ideas if relevant

## Edit Workflow

For `/blog image edit <path> <instructions>`:

1. Read the image path and edit instruction
2. Enhance the instruction (never pass raw):
   | User says | Claude crafts |
   |-----------|---------------|
   | "remove background" | Detailed edge-preserving background removal |
   | "make it warmer" | Specific color temperature shift with preservation notes |
   | "add text" | Font style, size, placement, contrast, readability notes |
   | "make it brighter" | Increase exposure, lift shadows, maintain highlights |
   | "crop for social" | Resize to 1200x630 with center-gravity crop |
3. Call `gemini_edit_image` with enhanced instruction
4. Return modified image path and description

## Internal API (for blog-write / blog-rewrite)

When invoked as a Task subagent from blog-write or blog-rewrite:

**Input** (provided by calling skill):
- `image_type`: hero, inline, og, divider
- `topic`: blog post topic/title
- `section_context`: (optional) heading or section the image supports
- `style_preference`: (optional) photorealistic, illustrated, editorial
- `count`: (optional) number of images needed (default: 1)

**Output** (returned to calling skill):
```markdown
### Generated Image
- **Path:** ~/Documents/nanobanana_generated/image_timestamp.png
- **Alt Text:** Descriptive sentence about the image
- **Type:** hero / inline / og
- **Domain Mode:** Editorial
- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **Suggested Frontmatter:**
  coverImage: "/path/to/image.png"
  coverImageAlt: "Alt text here"
```

**Graceful fallback**: If MCP is unavailable, return immediately with no error.
The calling workflow continues with stock photos. Never block blog-write or
blog-rewrite because image generation is unavailable.

## Alt Text Generation

For every generated image, create alt text following blog standards:
- Full descriptive sentence (not keyword list)
- 10-125 characters
- Include topic keywords naturally
- Describe what the image shows AND its relevance to the content
- For charts/infographics: include the key data point

Good: `Marketing team analyzing AI search traffic data on a dashboard showing citation metrics`
Bad: `SEO AI marketing blog optimization image`

## Setup

For `/blog image setup`:

1. Run `python3 scripts/setup_image_mcp.py` (interactive)
   - Or: `python3 scripts/setup_image_mcp.py --key YOUR_KEY` (non-interactive)
   - Default writes to `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-private, mode 0600)
   - `--project` flag opts into project `.mcp.json` (env-expansion only,
     refuses to write a literal key into a tracked file)
2. Verify: `python3 scripts/validate_image_setup.py`
3. Requires:
   - Node.js 18+ (npx)
   - Google AI API key (free at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
4. The script pins the package to `@ycse/nanobanana-mcp@1.1.1`. Update the
   pin in `setup_image_mcp.py` (constant `PINNED_PACKAGE`) when bumping.

## Safety Filter Auto-Rephrase

When `IMAGE_SAFETY` or `SAFETY` is returned, do NOT give up. Auto-rephrase and retry:

1. Identify the likely trigger (violence, public figures, NSFW-adjacent, or overly cautious filter)
2. Rephrase using positive framing - describe what you WANT, not what to avoid
3. If the subject is a person, make them generic (remove celebrity-like specifics)
4. If the scene is dramatic, soften: "intense" → "focused", "battle" → "competition"
5. Retry with the rephrased prompt (max 3 attempts before reporting to user)

Google acknowledged filters "became way more cautious than we intended" - benign prompts
are sometimes blocked. Persistence with rephrasing usually succeeds.

## Edit, Don't Re-roll

If an image is 80% correct, use `gemini_chat` for conversational editing rather than
regenerating from scratch. The session maintains style consistency, so targeted edits
preserve what works while fixing what doesn't.

**When to edit vs regenerate:**
- Color slightly off → Edit ("shift the color temperature warmer")
- Wrong composition entirely → Regenerate with revised brief
- Good scene but wrong lighting → Edit ("change to golden hour lighting from the left")
- Missing a detail → Edit ("add a steaming coffee cup on the desk")

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|
| MCP not configured | Run `/blog image setup` |
| API key invalid | New key at https://aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| Rate limited (429) | Wait 60s, retry. Free tier: ~5-15 RPM / ~20-500 RPD (varies by model and billing) |
| `IMAGE_SAFETY` | Auto-rephrase (see above) - Layer 2 filter, non-configurable |
| `PROHIBITED_CONTENT` | Content policy violation - topic is blocked. Non-retryable. |
| `SAFETY` | Rephrase prompt - Layer 1 filter |
| Vague request | Ask one clarifying question before generating |
| Poor quality | Review Reasoning Brief - likely missing lighting (biggest quality differentiator) |
| MCP unavailable (internal call) | Return silently - calling workflow uses stock photos |
