## The 6-Component Reasoning Brief

Every image prompt should contain these components, written as natural
narrative paragraphs - NEVER as comma-separated keyword lists.

### 1. Subject
The main focus of the image. Describe with physical specificity.

**Good:** "A weathered Japanese ceramicist in his 70s, deep sun-etched
wrinkles mapping decades of kiln work, calloused hands cradling a
freshly thrown tea bowl with an irregular, organic rim"

**Bad:** "old man, ceramic, bowl"

### 2. Action
What is happening. Movement, pose, gesture, state of being.

**Good:** "leaning forward with intense concentration, gently smoothing
the rim with a wet thumb, a thin trail of slip running down his wrist"

**Bad:** "making pottery"

### 3. Context
Environment, setting, temporal and spatial details.

**Good:** "inside a traditional wood-fired anagama kiln workshop,
stacked shelves of drying pots visible in the soft background, late
afternoon light filtering through rice paper screens"

**Bad:** "workshop, afternoon"

### 4. Composition
Camera angle, shot type, framing, spatial relationships.

**Good:** "intimate close-up shot from slightly below eye level,
shallow depth of field isolating the hands and bowl against the
soft bokeh of the workshop behind"

**Bad:** "close up"

### 5. Lighting
Light source, quality, direction, temperature, shadows.

**Good:** "warm directional light from a single high window camera-left,
creating gentle Rembrandt lighting on the face with a soft triangle
of light on the shadow-side cheek, deep warm shadows in the workshop"

**Bad:** "natural lighting"

### 6. Style
Art medium, aesthetic reference, technical photographic details.

**Good:** "captured with a Sony A7R IV, 85mm f/1.4 GM lens, Kodak Portra
400 color grading with lifted shadows and muted earth tones, reminiscent
of Dorothea Lange's documentary portraiture"

**Bad:** "photorealistic, 8K, masterpiece"

## Blog Image Types

Map blog use cases to domain modes and aspect ratios:

| Image Type | Aspect Ratio | Domain Mode | Prompt Focus |
|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hero/Cover | 16:9 | Editorial or Landscape | Wide composition, mood-setting, topic-relevant |
| OG/Social Card | 16:9 (1200x630) | Editorial or Infographic | Clean, readable at small sizes, topic icon |
| Inline Illustration | 16:9 or 4:3 | Varies by topic | Supports adjacent H2 content, contextual |
| Inline Product Shot | 4:3 or 1:1 | Product | Clean background, product focus |
| Section Divider | 8:1 or 4:1 | Abstract or Landscape | Wide strip, atmospheric, non-distracting |

## Blog-Specific Prompt Templates

### Hero/Cover Image
```

**Colors:** specify exact hex or descriptive palette (e.g., "cool blues #2563EB to #1E40AF")
**Sizing:** design at 2x for retina, specify exact pixel dimensions needed
**Backgrounds:** transparent (request solid white then post-process), gradient, solid color

### Infographic Mode
Best for: Data-driven posts, process explanations, comparison visuals.
**Layout:** modular sections, clear visual hierarchy, bento grid, flow top-to-bottom
**Text:** use quotes for exact text, descriptive font style, specify size hierarchy
**Data viz:** bar charts, pie charts, flow diagrams, timelines, comparison tables

## Search-Grounded Generation (NB2 Feature)

For blog images that need real-world accuracy (current products, real locations,
data-driven infographics), use Google Search grounding with this 3-part formula:

```
[Source/Search request] + [Analytical task] + [Visual translation]
```

**Example:** "Search for the top 5 AI coding tools by GitHub stars in 2026, analyze their relative popularity, then generate a clean infographic comparison chart in a modern dark theme."

Requires `googleSearch` tool enabled in the API call. MCP server handles this when available.

## Advanced Techniques

### Text-First Hack
For images with text, establish the concept conversationally FIRST ("I need a header with 'AI Search 2026'"), then generate. Always enclose text in quotation marks. The model anchors on text mentioned early in the conversation.

### Camera Hardware Naming
Name real camera hardware for precise aesthetics: "Sony A7III, 85mm f/1.4 lens" locks precise bokeh better than "shallow depth of field with bokeh".

### Character Consistency (Multi-turn)
Use `gemini_chat` and maintain descriptive anchors:
- First turn: Generate character with exhaustive physical description
- Following turns: Reference "the same character" + repeat 2-3 key identifiers
- Key identifiers: hair color/style, distinctive clothing, facial feature

### Text Rendering Tips
- Quote exact text: `with the text "OPEN DAILY" in bold condensed sans-serif`
- **25 characters or less** - practical limit for reliable rendering
- **2-3 distinct phrases max** - more text fragments degrade quality
- Describe font characteristics, not font names
- Specify placement: "centered at the top third", "along the bottom edge"
- High contrast: light text on dark, or vice versa

### Positive Framing (No Negative Prompts)
Gemini does NOT support negative prompts. Rephrase exclusions:
- Instead of "no blur" → "sharp, in-focus, tack-sharp detail"
- Instead of "no people" → "empty, deserted, uninhabited"
- Instead of "no text" → "clean, uncluttered, text-free"

## Creative Director Prompting (Advanced)

For premium blog hero images, specify all 4 professional dimensions:

### 1. Lighting Direction
- Studio: softbox at 45 degrees, rim light for separation
- Dramatic: single hard light with deep shadows
- Natural: golden hour, overcast diffusion, window light
- Flat: even illumination for product/editorial clarity

### 2. Camera & Lens Control
- Specify hardware: "shot on Sony A7IV with 85mm f/1.4"
- Focal length affects perspective: 24mm (wide, dramatic) vs 85mm (compressed, flattering)
- Depth of field: f/1.4 (dreamy bokeh) vs f/8 (sharp throughout)
- Distance: close-up (texture detail) vs establishing (context)

### 3. Film Stock & Color Grading
- Nostalgic: Kodak Portra 400 (warm skin tones, soft pastels)
- Modern: Fuji Pro 400H (cooler tones, clean shadows)
- Cinematic: teal-and-orange grading, crushed blacks
- Clean: neutral white balance, minimal grading

### 4. Material & Texture Definition
- Specify surfaces: "brushed aluminum", "rough linen", "polished marble"
- Fabric: "crisp cotton", "worn denim", "sheer silk"
- Environmental: "morning dew on glass", "rain-streaked concrete"
- Detail level influences realism and visual interest

## Common Prompt Mistakes

1. **Keyword stuffing** - "8K, masterpiece, best quality" adds nothing to Gemini
2. **Tag lists instead of prose** - Gemini wants narrative, not "red car, sunset, cinematic"
3. **Missing lighting** - Single biggest quality differentiator; always specify
4. **No composition direction** - Results in generic centered framing
5. **Ignoring aspect ratio** - Always call `set_aspect_ratio` before generating
6. **Overlong prompts** - Diminishing returns past ~200 words; be precise
7. **Text > 25 chars** - Rendering degrades; use text-first hack for accuracy
8. **Not iterating** - Use `gemini_chat` for refinement instead of re-generating
