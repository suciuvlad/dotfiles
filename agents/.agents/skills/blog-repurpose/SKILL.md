# Blog Repurpose: Cross-Platform Content Adaptation

Transforms blog posts into platform-optimized content for social media, email,
video, and community channels. Each output adapts tone, format, and length to
match platform conventions and audience expectations.

**FLOW dual-surface thinking (when applicable).** When the original blog post targets a query that also surfaces in a community (Reddit thread, YouTube comment, LinkedIn discussion), repurpose for the community in a way that reinforces the blog. Cross-link both directions: the blog references the community discussion as social proof; the community post references the blog as the canonical long-form answer. This is FLOW surface 5 in action. See `skills/blog/references/flow-alignment.md` and `/blog flow win` for the dual-surface scorecard.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read & Analyze

Read the blog post and extract the core content elements:

- **Title** - Original blog post title
- **Key insights** (5-7) - The most important takeaways, each as a standalone statement
- **Statistics** - All sourced data points with attribution
- **Quotes** - Any notable quotations or expert statements
- **Main argument** - The central thesis in 1-2 sentences
- **TL;DR** - A 2-3 sentence summary that delivers standalone value
- **Target audience** - Who the blog was written for
- **Topic category** - For subreddit and hashtag selection

### Step 2: Ask User

Prompt the user to select which platforms to generate content for:

1. Twitter/X thread
2. LinkedIn article
3. YouTube video script
4. Reddit discussion post
5. Email newsletter excerpt
6. All of the above

If the user specifies a platform directly (e.g., "repurpose for Twitter"),
skip this step and generate for that platform only.

### Step 3: Twitter/X Thread

Generate a complete thread optimized for Twitter/X engagement:

**Hook tweet** (tweet 1):
- Open with a curiosity gap or bold statistic
- Must be under 280 characters
- Should make someone stop scrolling
- Pattern: "[Surprising stat or contrarian take]. Here's what [audience] needs to know:"

**Insight tweets** (tweets 2-6):
- One key point per tweet, each delivering standalone value
- Include a statistic with source where possible
- Use line breaks for readability
- Each tweet should work even if read in isolation

**Closing tweet** (final):
- Summarize the main takeaway in one sentence
- Include a clear CTA linking to the full post
- Add relevant hashtags (maximum 2 per tweet)
- Pattern: "Read the full breakdown: [link]\n\n#hashtag1 #hashtag2"

**Thread formatting rules:**
- Number tweets as 1/, 2/, etc. for clarity
- No tweet exceeds 280 characters
- Thread length: 7-9 tweets total
- Tone: conversational, direct, insight-dense

### Step 4: LinkedIn Article

Adapt the blog for LinkedIn's professional audience and format:

**Length:** 800-1,200 words (shorter than the blog post)

**Opening** (first 2-3 lines visible before "See more"):
- Start with a personal story, observation, or contrarian take
- This is the hook - it must compel clicking "See more"
- Never start with "I'm excited to share..." or similar cliches

**Body structure:**
- Use LinkedIn-native formatting: bold text for emphasis, single-line paragraphs,
  generous line breaks between points
- Numbered lists for key takeaways
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each)
- Include 2-3 key statistics with sources
- More personal and opinion-led than the original blog

**Closing:**
- End with an engagement question that invites comments
- Pattern: "What's your experience with [topic]? I'd love to hear in the comments."
- Do NOT include external links in the body (LinkedIn deprioritizes them)
- Add the blog link in the first comment instead (note this in the output)

**Tone:** Professional but conversational. First-person perspective. Share
what you learned or observed, not just what the data says.

### Step 5: YouTube Script

Generate a complete video script structured for retention:

**Hook** (0-15 seconds):
- Bold statement or surprising question drawn from the blog's strongest insight
- Pattern: "Did you know that [shocking stat]? Today I'm going to show you [promise]."
- Must grab attention before viewers click away

**Intro** (15-60 seconds):
- What viewers will learn (3 bullet points)
- Why it matters right now
- Brief credibility statement
- "[SHOW TITLE CARD]"

**Main content** (3-5 talking points):
- Derived from the blog's H2 sections
- Each section: key point, supporting data, practical example
- Include visual cues throughout:
  - `[SHOW CHART: description]` - for data visualizations
  - `[CUT TO SCREENCAST]` - for demonstrations
  - `[B-ROLL: description]` - for visual variety
  - `[TEXT ON SCREEN: key stat]` - for emphasis
- Transition phrases between sections

**CTA** (final 15-30 seconds):
- Subscribe prompt with reason
- Link to full blog post in video description
- Tease next related video topic

**Script metadata:**
- Estimated duration based on word count (~150 words per minute of speech)
- Suggested title (under 60 chars, keyword-rich)
- Suggested thumbnail concept (text + visual)
- Description with timestamps, blog link, and key takeaways

### Step 6: Reddit Post

Reframe the blog content as an authentic community discussion:

**Subreddit suggestions:**
- Recommend 2-3 relevant subreddits based on the blog topic
- Consider subreddit size, rules, and posting conventions
- Check if the subreddit allows links or prefers text posts

**Post format:**
- Title: Frame as a question or observation, not a blog promotion
  - Good: "After analyzing 500 campaigns, here's what actually drives ROI"
  - Bad: "Check out my new blog post about marketing ROI"
- Lead with a question or interesting observation
- Share key findings as if reporting results to peers
- Use Reddit markdown formatting (headers, bullet points, bold)
- Include 3-5 key data points with sources
- End with a discussion prompt: "Has anyone else seen similar results?"

**Self-promotion compliance:**
- Follow the 10% rule: self-promotional content should be max 10% of posts
- Never use clickbait or misleading titles
- Provide genuine value in the post itself - readers should benefit without
  clicking through
- Include the blog link naturally at the end: "Full analysis with charts: [link]"

**Tone:** Peer-to-peer, humble, discussion-oriented. Never salesy.

### Step 7: Email Newsletter Excerpt

Generate a concise newsletter section optimized for email engagement:

**Subject line:**
- 40-60 characters
- Curiosity-driven or value-driven (not clickbait)
- Pattern options:
  - Curiosity: "The [topic] metric nobody tracks (but should)"
  - Value: "[N] [topic] insights from [source/study]"
  - Urgency: "[Topic] changed this month. Here's what to do."

**Preview text:**
- 40-90 characters that complement (not repeat) the subject line
- Appears after subject in inbox - treat as a second headline

**Body:**
- **TL;DR** (2-3 sentences): Standalone summary with the key takeaway
- **3 key takeaways** (bullet points): Each with a statistic and source
- **CTA**: Clear link to the full blog post
  - Button text: "Read the full analysis" or similar action-oriented phrase

**Total length:** 150-200 words. Every word must earn its place.

**Formatting:**
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Bold key phrases for scanners
- Single CTA (do not compete with multiple links)

### Step 8: Save

Save all generated outputs to the `repurposed/` directory with platform-specific
filenames:

```
repurposed/
  {slug}-twitter-thread.md
  {slug}-linkedin-article.md
  {slug}-youtube-script.md
  {slug}-reddit-post.md
  {slug}-email-newsletter.md
```

If the `repurposed/` directory does not exist, create it.

Present a summary after saving:

```
## Repurposed Content: [Blog Title]

### Generated Outputs
